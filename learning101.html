    <h1>WHY YOU SHOULD DONATE BLOOD</h1>
    <p>
        Blood is essential to help patients survive surgeries, cancer treatment, chronic illnesses, and traumatic injuries.
        This lifesaving care starts with one person making a generous donation. The need for blood is constant.
        But only about 3% of age-eligible people donate blood yearly.
